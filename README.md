# The Budget App

## A place to keep all expenses while traveling

Use *this* app to help:
- Keep track of your purchases
- Track how much money you have spent

The application I plan to create is a **budget application**. The application
helps users keep track of their purchases, shows them their past
purchases and how much money they have spent. This application can be used by amy user
 who wants to keep monitor their latest purchases, as well as have a record of them.
track of their latest purchases, as well as monitoring. This project is of interest to me
because, I usually forget to track my purchases. In other words, it would be nice
to keep track of my latest purchases and see what my activity has been like. 
I tend to travel a lot, and forget how much I may have spent or what I spent it 
on days later. This application would be a great solution to that problem.
