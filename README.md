# BudgetGuard

## A place to keep all budgets and expenses 

Use *this* app to:
- Create budgets that keep track of your purchases
- Track how much money you have spent

The application I plan to create is a **budget application**. The application
helps users keep track of their purchases, shows them their past
purchases and how much money they have spent. This application can be used by any user
who wants to monitor their latest purchases, as well as have a record of them.
This project is of interest to me because, I usually forget to track my purchases. I 
try to remember my past purchases by putting them in my phone, but always forget. It would be nice
to keep track of my latest purchases and see what my activity has been like so I know
how much I am spending, as well as what I am spending my money on. I tend to travel a lot, and forget how much 
I may have spent or what I spent it on days later. This application would be a great solution to that problem.
